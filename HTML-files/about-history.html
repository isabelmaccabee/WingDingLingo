			<h4>Wingdings</h4>
			<p>Wingdings is a TrueType dingbat font included in all versions of Microsoft Windows from version 3.1 onwards.[4]

			The Wingdings trademark is owned by Microsoft,[4] and the design and glyph order was awarded U.S. Design Patent D341848 in 1993.[5][6] The patent expired in 2005. In many other countries, a Design Patent would be called a registered design. It is registration of a design to deter imitation, rather than a claim of a novel invention.

			This font contains many largely recognized shapes and gestures as well as some recognized world symbols, such as the Star of David, the symbols of the zodiac, index or manicle signs, hand gestures, and obscure ampersands.</p>
